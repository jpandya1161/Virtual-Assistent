# Virtual_Assistent
Users can ask their assistants questions, control home automation devices and media playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks such as email, to-do lists, and calendars with verbal commands.
Some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices. 
Their role will be highly defined without variation unless you take extra time to give additional instruction.
